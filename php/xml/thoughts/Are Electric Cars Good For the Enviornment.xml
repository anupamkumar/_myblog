But are they really &quot;green&quot; and eco-friendly ?&lt;/h3&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have found that the battery in these electric cars are non-reusable after a certain time, very toxic and non-bio-degradable. This means that once a battery runs out of juice, it will be turned into ultra toxic landfill or will be dropped off in the middle of Pacific Ocean and pollute the waters.&lt;br/&gt;So far disposing them off safely is not possible. But hopefully we will solve this problem in the future&lt;/p&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;strong&gt;Reference:&lt;/strong&gt;<br/>&lt;p&gt;<br/>Study: &#x2018;Green&#x2019; Cars More Harmful to the Environment Than Gas-Powered Vehicles? - <br/>[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/07/02/study-green-cars-more-harmful-to-the-environment-than-gas-powered-vehicles/&quot;&gt;http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/07/02/study-green-cars-more-harmful-to-the-environment-than-gas-powered-vehicles/&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;</body><references></references></doc>
