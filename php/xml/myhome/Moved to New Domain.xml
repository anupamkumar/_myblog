<doc><title>Moved to New Domain</title><author>Anupam Kumar</author><publishdate>Published On 17th Feb, 2015</publishdate><body>&lt;p&gt;Finally made the move to my own domain and not part of a free domain. The hosting is still on free tier (will move to paid tier, if the hosting service is good), but the domain name is not. 
&lt;p&gt;Apparently my old domain site had accessibility issues. I too had faced it a few times, but I thought that problem had resolved itself. Unfortunately it did not. Funnily enough the hardest part in the transition was not configuring the new domain, but getting my file off my old free host server. The FTP server had some quota issues with my account (&lt;a href=&quot;/myhome/2&quot;&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt; to read more) and I had a really hard time getting my files to my PC. 

&lt;p&gt;Boy, glad that's over. 
&lt;p&gt;Also While making the transition I realized a few design flaws with this site. For one, I don't have a feature to sort my blog post, by published date. The default way that the articles get sorted is by last updated time. Why ? Because I had originally thought that it made sense because the reader would come to read the updated article first because it would &quot;bubble to the top of the list in that section&quot;. However, this idea goes down the drain when you're migrating because all your files get the last updated time as the created time in the new domain. Having realized this, I think my next improvement of this website, from a technical perspective is to implement and enable sorting of files by published date and by last edited/last updated date.
