<doc><title>LA Marathon - There or be Square!</title><author>Anupam</author><publishdate>Published On 3rd March, 2014</publishdate><body>&lt;h3&gt;LA Marathon is coming up! Get ready! It's happening! When you ask ? This Sunday!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marathon is officially sold out. Around 25000 people have already signed up for the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The run begins at Dodger stadium and ends at Ocean Ave cross California Avenue. If you have not registered, and you're still interested to participate, you can spectate for the event. I personally can't wait for the marathon.&lt;/p&gt;
