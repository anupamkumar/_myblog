<doc><title>How to get your impounded vehicle in GTA online</title><author>Anupam Kumar</author><publishdate>Published On 13th October, 2014</publishdate><body>Has your personal vehicle ever been impounded by the cops ? Did you have a hard time stealing the vehicle from the cops ? While playing online, I accidentally came across this loop-hole for getting impounded vehicles out. 

&lt;p&gt;All you need to do, to get the your vehicle out, is start a mission (preferably one given by Simion, Gerald or Lamar, because they are generally not timed) and Simply get inside the impound and drive your vehicle out without getting any stars or any cops on your tail! Simple!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Happy GTAing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;</body><references></references></doc>
