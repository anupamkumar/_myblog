<h3><em>About me:</em></h3>
<p> Hi! I am Anupam Kumar (Call me Anupam or Anu). I was a Master's student in Computer Science 
at the <a href="http://www.usc.edu/" target="_blank"> University of Southern California </a>. I was a Graduate Assistant too and therefore was able to freeload off of USC! :P 
But Seriously though, USC is a great school for Electrical and Computer Science and I was fortunate enough to get a tution waiver and stipend during my Masters there. Anyways...<p>I have created this website to use it as my personal blog. Here, I will put in all the things that amuse me. Hopefully you too will be amused.</p>
