    <body>&lt;h3&gt;Rain feels awesome&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; It's been raining almost continuously since yesterday. And it's quite a change in the weather. Although I like the sunny day in Los Angeles, the rainy weather is a welcome change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My weather app - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/breez/d2455d62-0dbe-4c3f-b427-be7a179c8218&quot;&gt; breez &lt;/a&gt;, predicts that LA will recieve rain for another day. &lt;h3&gt;The greatest Stunt in GTA5&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like to follow people who play video games and I found this gem on reddit.com&lt;/p&gt; &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/djG4ZFM9H9I&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;p&gt;Digging around I found that the creators of this video is made by folks at Rooster Teeth, who were one of the first production studio to produce Machinama, before Machinama was even a thing.&lt;/p&gt;</body>
